From the MUMs (or MRMs), our algorithm selects appropriate matches which are related to the cDNA mapping. We call the selection the match chaining problem. Several O(klogk)-time algorithms are known where k is the number of the input matches, but they do not permit overlaps of the matches. We propose a new O(klogk)-time algorithm for the problem with provision for overlaps. Previously, only an O(k2)-time algorithm existed. Furthermore, we also incorporate a restriction on the distances between matches for accurate cDNA mapping. We examine the performance of our algorithm through computational experiments using sequences of the FANTOM mouse cDNA database and the mouse genome. According to the experiments, the MCCM algorithm is not only very fast, but also very accurate: We achieved {\textgreater}95\% specificity and {\textgreater}97\% sensitivity at the same time against the mapping results of the FANTOM annotators.},

	abstract = {Viruses populate their hosts as a viral quasispecies: a collection of genetically related mutant strains. Viral quasispecies assembly is the reconstruction of strain-specific haplotypes from read data, and predicting their relative abundances within the mix of strains is an important step for various treatment-related reasons. Reference-genome-independent ({\textquotedblleft}de novo{\textquotedblright}) approaches have yielded benefits over reference-guided approaches, because reference-induced biases can become overwhelming when dealing with divergent strains. While being very accurate, extant de novo methods only yield rather short contigs. The remaining challenge is to reconstruct full-length haplotypes together with their abundances from such contigs. We present Virus-VG as a de novo approach to viral haplotype reconstruction from pre-assembled contigs. Our method constructs a variation graph from the short input contigs without making use of a reference genome. Then, to obtain paths through the variation graph that reflect the original haplotypes, we solve a minimization problem that yields a selection of maximal-length paths that is optimal in terms of being compatible with the read coverages computed for the nodes of the variation graph. We output the resulting selection of maximal length paths as the haplotypes, together with their abundances. Benchmarking experiments on challenging simulated and real data sets show significant improvements in assembly contiguity compared to the input contigs, while preserving low error rates compared to the state-of-the-art viral quasispecies assemblers.

	doi = {10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621555},
	abstract = {Many genetic variants have been reported from sequencing projects due to decreasing experimental costs. Compared to the current typical paradigm, read mapping incorporating existing variants can improve the performance of subsequent analysis. However, storing and indexing various types of variation require costly RAM space. Aligning reads to a graph model-based index including the whole set of variants is ultimately an NP-hard problem in theory. This method is supposed to map sequencing reads efficiently to a graphical index with a reference genome and known variation to increase alignment quality and variant calling accuracy. Herein, we propose a variation-aware read alignment algorithm (VARA), which generates the alignment between read and multiple genomic sequences simultaneously utilizing the schema of the Landau-Vishkin algorithm. VARA dynamically extracts regional variants to construct a pseudo tree-based structure on-the-fly for seed extension without loading the whole genome variation into memory space. We developed the novel high-throughput sequencing read aligner deBGA-VARA by integrating VARA into deBGA. The deBGA-VARA is benchmarked both on simulated reads and the NA12878 sequencing dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that read alignment incorporating genetic variation knowledge can achieve high sensitivity and accuracy. Moreover, due to its efficiency, VARA provides a promising solution for further improvement of variant calling while maintaining small memory footprints. The deBGA-VARA is available at: https://github.com/hitbc/deBGA-VARA.},

	abstract = {Genome variation graphs are natural candidates to represent a pangenome collection. In such graphs, common subsequences are encoded as vertices and the genomic variations are captured by introducing additional labeled vertices and directed edges. Unlike a linear reference, a reference graph allows a rich representation of the genomic diversities and avoids reference bias. We address the fundamental problem of mapping reads to genome variation graphs. We give a novel mapping algorithm V-MAP for efficient identification of small subgraph of the genome graph for optimal gapped alignment of the read. V-MAP creates space efficient index using locality sensitive minimizer signatures computed using a novel graph winnowing and graph embedding onto metric space for fast and accurate mapping. Experiments involving graph constructed from the 1000 Genomes data and using both real and simulated reads show that V-MAP is fast, memory efficient and can map short reads, as well as PacBio/Nanopore long reads with high accuracy. V-MAP performance was significantly better than the state-of-the-art, especially for long reads.},

In genome assembly and genetics, the possible paths through a superbubble can be considered to represent the set of possible sequences at a location in a genome. Bidirected and biedged graphs are a generalization of digraphs that are increasingly being used to more fully represent genome assembly and variation problems. In this study, we define snarls and ultrabubbles, generalizations of superbubbles for bidirected and biedged graphs, and give an efficient algorithm for the detection of these more general structures. Key to this algorithm is the cactus graph, which, we show, encodes the nested decomposition of a graph into snarls and ultrabubbles within its structure. We propose and demonstrate empirically that this decomposition on bidirected and biedged graphs solves a fundamental problem by defining genetic sites for any collection of genomic variations, including complex structural variations, without need for any single reference genome coordinate system. Further, the nesting of the decomposition gives a natural way to describe and model variations contained within large variations, a case not currently dealt with by existing formats [e.g., variant cell format (VCF)].},

In genome assembly and genetics, the possible paths through a superbubble can be considered to represent the set of possible sequences at a location in a genome. Bidirected and biedged graphs are a generalization of digraphs that are increasingly being used to more fully represent genome assembly and variation problems. In this study, we define snarls and ultrabubbles, generalizations of superbubbles for bidirected and biedged graphs, and give an efficient algorithm for the detection of these more general structures. Key to this algorithm is the cactus graph, which, we show, encodes the nested decomposition of a graph into snarls and ultrabubbles within its structure. We propose and demonstrate empirically that this decomposition on bidirected and biedged graphs solves a fundamental problem by defining genetic sites for any collection of genomic variations, including complex structural variations, without need for any single reference genome coordinate system. Further, the nesting of the decomposition gives a natural way to describe and model variations contained within large variations, a case not currently dealt with by existing formats [e.g., variant cell format (VCF)].},

Our method precomputes distance labels for vertices by performing a breadth-first search from every vertex. Seemingly too obvious and too inefficient at first glance, the key ingredient introduced here is pruning during breadth-first searches. While we can still answer the correct distance for any pair of vertices from the labels, it surprisingly reduces the search space and sizes of labels. Moreover, we show that we can perform 32 or 64 breadth-first searches simultaneously exploiting bitwise operations. We experimentally demonstrate that the combination of these two techniques is efficient and robust on various kinds of large-scale real-world networks. In particular, our method can handle social networks and web graphs with hundreds of millions of edges, which are two orders of magnitude larger than the limits of previous exact methods, with comparable query time to those of previous methods.},

To help translate these methods to routine research and clinical practice, we developed a sequence-resolved benchmark set for identification of both false-negative and false-positive germline large insertions and deletions. To create this benchmark for a broadly consented son in a Personal Genome Project trio with broadly available cells and DNA, the Genome in a Bottle Consortium integrated 19 sequence-resolved variant calling methods from diverse technologies. The final benchmark set contains 12,745 isolated, sequence-resolved insertion (7,281) and deletion (5,464) calls >=50 base pairs (bp). The Tier 1 benchmark regions, for which any extra calls are putative false positives, cover 2.51 Gbp and 5,262 insertions and 4,095 deletions supported by >=1 diploid assembly. We demonstrate that the benchmark set reliably identifies false negatives and false positives in high-quality SV callsets from short-, linked- and long-read sequencing and optical mapping. Detection of structural variants in the human genome is facilitated by a benchmark set of large deletions and insertions.},

As sequencing costs have dropped, thousands of new genomes have been sequenced, and scientists have come to realize that a single reference genome is inadequate for many purposes. By sampling a diverse set of individuals, one can begin to assemble a pan-genome: a collection of all the DNA sequences that occur in a species. Here we review efforts to create pan-genomes for a range of species, from bacteria to humans, and we further consider the computational methods that have been proposed in order to capture, interpret and compare pan-genome data. As scientists continue to survey and catalogue the genomic variation across human populations and begin to assemble a human pan-genome, these efforts will increase our power to connect variation to human diversity, disease and beyond.},

	abstract = {The human reference genome serves as the foundation for genomics by providing a scaffold for alignment of sequencing reads, but currently only reflects a single consensus haplotype, thus impairing analysis accuracy. Here we present a graph reference genome implementation that enables read alignment across 2,800 diploid genomes encompassing 12.6 million SNPs and 4.0 million insertions and deletions (indels). The pipeline processes one whole-genome sequencing sample in 6.5 h using a system with 36 CPU cores. We show that using a graph genome reference improves read mapping sensitivity and produces a 0.5\% increase in variant calling recall, with unaffected specificity. Structural variations incorporated into a graph genome can be genotyped accurately under a unified framework. Finally, we show that iterative augmentation of graph genomes yields incremental gains in variant calling accuracy. Our implementation is an important advance toward fulfilling the promise of graph genomes to radically enhance the scalability and accuracy of genomic analyses.},

It automatically chooses between local and end-to-end alignments, supports paired-end reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is robust to sequencing errors and applicable to a wide range of sequence lengths from 70bp to a few megabases. For mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better performance than several state-of-art read aligners to date. Availability and implementation: BWA-MEM is implemented as a component of BWA, which is available at http://github.com/lh3/bwa. Contact: hengli@broadinstitute.org},

  abstract = {Structural variants (SVs) are an important source of human genetic diversity, but their contribution to traits, disease and gene regulation remains unclear. We mapped cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in 13 tissues via joint analysis of SVs, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertion/deletion (indel) variants from deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We estimated that SVs are causal at 3.5-6.8\% of eQTLs-a substantially higher fraction than prior estimates-and that expression-altering SVs have larger effect sizes than do SNVs and indels. We identified 789 putative causal SVs predicted to directly alter gene expression: most (88.3\%) were noncoding variants enriched at enhancers and other regulatory elements, and 52 were linked to genome-wide association study loci. We observed a notable abundance of rare high-impact SVs associated with aberrant expression of nearby genes. These results suggest that comprehensive WGS-based SV analyses will increase the power of common- and rare-variant association studies.},

	abstract = {Pangenomics is emerging as a powerful computational paradigm in bioinformatics. This field uses population-level genome reference structures, typically consisting of a sequence graph, to mitigate reference bias and facilitate analyses that were challenging with previous reference-based methods. In this work, we extend these methods into transcriptomics to analyze sequencing data using the pantranscriptome: a population-level transcriptomic reference. Our toolchain, which consists of additions to the VG toolkit and a standalone tool, RPVG, can construct spliced pangenome graphs, map RNA sequencing data to these graphs, and perform haplotype-aware expression quantification of transcripts in a pantranscriptome. We show that this workflow improves accuracy over state-of-the-art RNA sequencing mapping methods, and that it can efficiently quantify haplotype-specific transcript expression without needing to characterize the haplotypes of a sample beforehand.},

	abstract = {DNA sequencing has revolutionized medicine over recent decades. However, analysis of large structural variation and repetitive DNA, a hallmark of human genomes, has been limited by short-read technology, with read lengths of 100–300 bp. Long-read sequencing (LRS) permits routine sequencing of human DNA fragments tens to hundreds of kilobase pairs in size, using both real-time sequencing by synthesis and nanopore-based direct electronic sequencing. LRS permits analysis of large structural variation and haplotypic phasing in human genomes and has enabled the discovery and characterization of rare pathogenic structural variants and repeat expansions. It has also recently enabled the assembly of a complete, gapless human genome that includes previously intractable regions, such as highly repetitive centromeres and homologous acrocentric short arms. With the addition of protocols for targeted enrichment, direct epigenetic DNA modification detection, and long-range chromatin profiling, LRS promises to launch a new era of understanding of genetic diversity and pathogenic mutations in human populations.},

    abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput long-read sequencers, such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore sequencers, produce longer reads with more errors than short-read sequencers. In addition to the high error rates of reads, non-uniformity of errors leads to difficulties in various downstream analyses using long reads. Many useful simulators, which characterize long-read error patterns and simulate them, have been developed. However, there is still room for improvement in the simulation of the non-uniformity of errors.To capture characteristics of errors in reads for long-read sequencers, here, we introduce a generative model for quality scores, in which a hidden Markov Model with a latest model selection method, called factorized information criteria, is utilized. We evaluated our developed simulator from various points, indicating that our simulator successfully simulates reads that are consistent with real reads.The source codes of PBSIM2 are freely available from https://github.com/yukiteruono/pbsim2.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

          Accurate standards and extensive development datasets are the foundation of technical progress. To facilitate benchmarking and development, we sequence 9 samples, covering the Genome in a Bottle truth sets on multiple instruments (NovaSeq, HiSeqX, HiSeq4000, PacBio Sequel II System) and sample preparations (PCR-Free, PCR-Positive) for both whole genome and multiple exome kits. We benchmark pipelines, quantifying strengths and limitations for sequencing and analysis methods. We identify variability within and between instruments, preparation methods, and analytical pipelines, across various sequencing depths. We discuss the relevance of this variability to downstream analyses, and strategies to reduce variability.},
