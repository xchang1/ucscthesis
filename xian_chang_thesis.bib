	title = {Full-length de novo viral quasispecies assembly through variation graph construction},
	abstract = {Viruses populate their hosts as a viral quasispecies: a collection of genetically related mutant strains. Viral quasispecies assembly is the reconstruction of strain-specific haplotypes from read data, and predicting their relative abundances within the mix of strains is an important step for various treatment-related reasons. Reference-genome-independent ({\textquotedblleft}de novo{\textquotedblright}) approaches have yielded benefits over reference-guided approaches, because reference-induced biases can become overwhelming when dealing with divergent strains. While being very accurate, extant de novo methods only yield rather short contigs. The remaining challenge is to reconstruct full-length haplotypes together with their abundances from such contigs. We present Virus-VG as a de novo approach to viral haplotype reconstruction from pre-assembled contigs. Our method constructs a variation graph from the short input contigs without making use of a reference genome. Then, to obtain paths through the variation graph that reflect the original haplotypes, we solve a minimization problem that yields a selection of maximal-length paths that is optimal in terms of being compatible with the read coverages computed for the nodes of the variation graph. We output the resulting selection of maximal length paths as the haplotypes, together with their abundances. Benchmarking experiments on challenging simulated and real data sets show significant improvements in assembly contiguity compared to the input contigs, while preserving low error rates compared to the state-of-the-art viral quasispecies assemblers.

	doi = {10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621555},
	abstract = {Many genetic variants have been reported from sequencing projects due to decreasing experimental costs. Compared to the current typical paradigm, read mapping incorporating existing variants can improve the performance of subsequent analysis. However, storing and indexing various types of variation require costly RAM space. Aligning reads to a graph model-based index including the whole set of variants is ultimately an NP-hard problem in theory. This method is supposed to map sequencing reads efficiently to a graphical index with a reference genome and known variation to increase alignment quality and variant calling accuracy. Herein, we propose a variation-aware read alignment algorithm (VARA), which generates the alignment between read and multiple genomic sequences simultaneously utilizing the schema of the Landau-Vishkin algorithm. VARA dynamically extracts regional variants to construct a pseudo tree-based structure on-the-fly for seed extension without loading the whole genome variation into memory space. We developed the novel high-throughput sequencing read aligner deBGA-VARA by integrating VARA into deBGA. The deBGA-VARA is benchmarked both on simulated reads and the NA12878 sequencing dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that read alignment incorporating genetic variation knowledge can achieve high sensitivity and accuracy. Moreover, due to its efficiency, VARA provides a promising solution for further improvement of variant calling while maintaining small memory footprints. The deBGA-VARA is available at: https://github.com/hitbc/deBGA-VARA.},

	abstract = {Genome variation graphs are natural candidates to represent a pangenome collection. In such graphs, common subsequences are encoded as vertices and the genomic variations are captured by introducing additional labeled vertices and directed edges. Unlike a linear reference, a reference graph allows a rich representation of the genomic diversities and avoids reference bias. We address the fundamental problem of mapping reads to genome variation graphs. We give a novel mapping algorithm V-MAP for efficient identification of small subgraph of the genome graph for optimal gapped alignment of the read. V-MAP creates space efficient index using locality sensitive minimizer signatures computed using a novel graph winnowing and graph embedding onto metric space for fast and accurate mapping. Experiments involving graph constructed from the 1000 Genomes data and using both real and simulated reads show that V-MAP is fast, memory efficient and can map short reads, as well as PacBio/Nanopore long reads with high accuracy. V-MAP performance was significantly better than the state-of-the-art, especially for long reads.},

In genome assembly and genetics, the possible paths through a superbubble can be considered to represent the set of possible sequences at a location in a genome. Bidirected and biedged graphs are a generalization of digraphs that are increasingly being used to more fully represent genome assembly and variation problems. In this study, we define snarls and ultrabubbles, generalizations of superbubbles for bidirected and biedged graphs, and give an efficient algorithm for the detection of these more general structures. Key to this algorithm is the cactus graph, which, we show, encodes the nested decomposition of a graph into snarls and ultrabubbles within its structure. We propose and demonstrate empirically that this decomposition on bidirected and biedged graphs solves a fundamental problem by defining genetic sites for any collection of genomic variations, including complex structural variations, without need for any single reference genome coordinate system. Further, the nesting of the decomposition gives a natural way to describe and model variations contained within large variations, a case not currently dealt with by existing formats [e.g., variant cell format (VCF)].},

Classical algorithms (such as, Dijkstra) solve this problem in polynomial time, but these algorithms cannot provide real-time response for a large number of bursty queries on a large graph. So, indexing based solutions that pre-process the graph for efficiently answering (exactly or approximately) a large number of distance queries in real-time are becoming increasingly popular. Existing solutions have varying performance in terms of index size, index building time, query time, and accuracy. In this work, we propose TopCom, a novel indexing-based solution for exactly answering distance queries in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Our experiments with two of the existing state-of-the-art methods (IS-Label and TreeMap) show the superiority of TopCom over these two methods considering scalability and query time.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICDE.2012.53},
	abstract = {Shortest distance query between two nodes is a fundamental operation in large-scale networks. Most existing methods in the literature take a landmark embedding approach, which selects a set of graph nodes as landmarks and computes the shortest distances from each landmark to all nodes as an embedding. To handle a shortest distance query between two nodes, the precomputed distances from the landmarks to the query nodes are used to compute an approximate shortest distance based on the triangle inequality. In this paper, we analyze the factors that affect the accuracy of the distance estimation in the landmark embedding approach. In particular we find that a globally selected, query-independent landmark set plus the triangulation based distance estimation introduces a large relative error, especially for nearby query nodes. To address this issue, we propose a query-dependent local landmark scheme, which identifies a local landmark close to the specific query nodes and provides a more accurate distance estimation than the traditional global landmark approach. Specifically, a local landmark is defined as the least common ancestor of the two query nodes in the shortest path tree rooted at a global landmark. We propose efficient local landmark indexing and retrieval techniques, which are crucial to achieve low offline indexing complexity and online query complexity. Two optimization techniques on graph compression and graph online search are also proposed, with the goal to further reduce index size and improve query accuracy. Our experimental results on large-scale social networks and road networks demonstrate that the local landmark scheme reduces the shortest distance estimation error significantly when compared with global landmark embedding.},

A dominant method of such string matching is the {\textquoteleft}seedand-extend{\textquoteright} approach, in which occurrences of short subsequences called {\textquoteleft}seeds{\textquoteright} are used to search for potentially longer matches in a large database of sequences. Each such potential match is then checked to see if it extends beyond the seed. To be effective, the seed-and-extend approach needs to catalogue seeds from virtually every substring in the database of search strings. Projects such as mammalian genome assemblies and large-scale protein matching, however, have such large sequence databases that the resulting list of seeds cannot be stored in RAM on a single computer.

Here we present methods to make high-confidence, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), indel and homozygous reference genotype calls for NA12878, the pilot genome for the Genome in a Bottle Consortium. We minimize bias toward any method by integrating and arbitrating between 14 data sets from five sequencing technologies, seven read mappers and three variant callers. We identify regions for which no confident genotype call could be made, and classify them into different categories based on reasons for uncertainty.

In case of Homo sapiens, the number of sequenced genomes will approach hundreds of thousands in the next few years. Simply scaling up established bioinformatics pipelines will not be sufficient for leveraging the full potential of such rich genomic data sets. Instead, novel, qualitatively different computational methods and paradigms are needed. We will witness the rapid extension of computational pan-genomics, a new sub-area of research in computational biology. In this article, we generalize existing definitions and understand a pangenome as any collection of genomic sequences to be analyzed jointly or to be used as a reference. We examine already available approaches to construct and use pan-genomes, discuss the potential benefits of future technologies and methodologies and review open challenges from the vantage point of the above-mentioned biological disciplines. As a prominent example for a computational paradigm shift, we particularly highlight the transition from the representation of reference genomes as strings to representations as graphs. We outline how this and other challenges from different application domains translate into common computational problems, point out relevant bioinformatics techniques and identify open problems in computer science. With this review, we aim to increase awareness that a joint approach to computational pangenomics can help address many of the problems currently faced in various domains.},

In genome assembly and genetics, the possible paths through a superbubble can be considered to represent the set of possible sequences at a location in a genome. Bidirected and biedged graphs are a generalization of digraphs that are increasingly being used to more fully represent genome assembly and variation problems. In this study, we define snarls and ultrabubbles, generalizations of superbubbles for bidirected and biedged graphs, and give an efficient algorithm for the detection of these more general structures. Key to this algorithm is the cactus graph, which, we show, encodes the nested decomposition of a graph into snarls and ultrabubbles within its structure. We propose and demonstrate empirically that this decomposition on bidirected and biedged graphs solves a fundamental problem by defining genetic sites for any collection of genomic variations, including complex structural variations, without need for any single reference genome coordinate system. Further, the nesting of the decomposition gives a natural way to describe and model variations contained within large variations, a case not currently dealt with by existing formats [e.g., variant cell format (VCF)].},

While we can still answer the correct distance for any pair of vertices from the labels, it surprisingly reduces the search space and sizes of labels. Moreover, we show that we can perform 32 or 64 breadth-first searches simultaneously exploiting bitwise operations. We experimentally demonstrate that the combination of these two techniques is efficient and robust on various kinds of large-scale real-world networks.

              Motivation
              Graph representations of genomes are capable of expressing more genetic variation and can therefore better represent a population than standard linear genomes. However, due to the greater complexity of genome graphs relative to linear genomes, some functions that are trivial on linear genomes become much more difficult in genome graphs. Calculating distance is one such function that is simple in a linear genome but complicated in a graph context. In read mapping algorithms such distance calculations are fundamental to determining if seed alignments could belong to the same mapping.


              Results
              We have developed an algorithm for quickly calculating the minimum distance between positions on a sequence graph using a minimum distance index. We have also developed an algorithm that uses the distance index to cluster seeds on a graph. We demonstrate that our implementations of these algorithms are efficient and practical to use for a new generation of mapping algorithms based upon genome graphs.

The Tier 1 benchmark regions, for which any extra calls are putative false positives, cover 2.51 Gbp and 5,262 insertions and 4,095 deletions supported by >=1 diploid assembly. We demonstrate that the benchmark set reliably identifies false negatives and false positives in high-quality SV callsets from short-, linked- and long-read sequencing and optical mapping.

As sequencing costs have dropped, thousands of new genomes have been sequenced, and scientists have come to realize that a single reference genome is inadequate for many purposes. By sampling a diverse set of individuals, one can begin to assemble a pan-genome: a collection of all the DNA sequences that occur in a species. Here we review efforts to create pan-genomes for a range of species, from bacteria to humans, and we further consider the computational methods that have been proposed in order to capture, interpret and compare pan-genome data. As scientists continue to survey and catalogue the genomic variation across human populations and begin to assemble a human pan-genome, these efforts will increase our power to connect variation to human diversity, disease and beyond.},

The additional information provided to these methods by the pangenome allows them to achieve superior performance on a variety of bioinformatic tasks, including read alignment, variant calling, and genotyping. Pangenome graphs stand to become a ubiquitous tool in genomics.

We use HISAT2 to represent and search an expanded model of the human reference genome in which over 14.5 million genomic variants in combination with haplotypes are incorporated into the data structure used for searching and alignment. We benchmark HISAT2 using simulated and real datasets to demonstrate that our strategy of representing a population of genomes, together with a fast, memory-efficient search algorithm, provides more detailed and accurate variant analyses than other methods. We apply HISAT2 for HLA typing and DNA fingerprinting; both applications form part of the HISAT-genotype software that enables analysis of haplotype-resolved genes or genomic regions.

The pipeline processes one whole-genome sequencing sample in 6.5 h using a system with 36 CPU cores. We show that using a graph genome reference improves read mapping sensitivity and produces a 0.5\% increase in variant calling recall, with unaffected specificity. Structural variations incorporated into a graph genome can be genotyped accurately under a unified framework.

  abstract = {Structural variants (SVs) are an important source of human genetic diversity, but their contribution to traits, disease and gene regulation remains unclear. We mapped cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in 13 tissues via joint analysis of SVs, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertion/deletion (indel) variants from deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We estimated that SVs are causal at 3.5-6.8\% of eQTLs-a substantially higher fraction than prior estimates-and that expression-altering SVs have larger effect sizes than do SNVs and indels. We identified 789 putative causal SVs predicted to directly alter gene expression: most (88.3\%) were noncoding variants enriched at enhancers and other regulatory elements, and 52 were linked to genome-wide association study loci. We observed a notable abundance of rare high-impact SVs associated with aberrant expression of nearby genes. These results suggest that comprehensive WGS-based SV analyses will increase the power of common- and rare-variant association studies.},

	abstract = {Summary: Although de novo assembly graphs contain assembled contigs (nodes), the connections between those contigs (edges) are difficult for users to access. Bandage (a Bioinformatics Application for Navigating De~novo Assembly Graphs Easily) is a tool for visualizing assembly graphs with connections. Users can zoom in to specific areas of the graph and interact with it by moving nodes, adding labels, changing colors and extracting sequences. BLAST searches can be performed within the Bandage graphical user interface and the hits are displayed as highlights in the graph. By displaying connections between contigs, Bandage presents new possibilities for analyzing de novo assemblies that are not possible through investigation of contigs alone.Availability and implementation: Source code and binaries are freely available at https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage. Bandage is implemented in C++ and supported on Linux, OS X and Windows. A full feature list and screenshots are available at http://rrwick.github.io/Bandage.Contact:rrwick@gmail.comSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

With time, the functionality of SPAdes was extended to enable assembly of IonTorrent data, as well as hybrid assembly from short and long reads (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore). In this article we present protocols for five different assembly pipelines that comprise the SPAdes package and that are used for assembly of metagenomes and transcriptomes as well as assembly of putative plasmids and biosynthetic gene clusters from whole-genome sequencing and metagenomic datasets.

We mapped cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in 13 tissues via joint analysis of SVs, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertion/deletion (indel) variants from deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We estimated that SVs are causal at 3.5-6.8\% of eQTLs-a substantially higher fraction than prior estimates-and that expression-altering SVs have larger effect sizes than do SNVs and indels. We identified 789 putative causal SVs predicted to directly alter gene expression: most (88.3\%) were noncoding variants enriched at enhancers and other regulatory elements, and 52 were linked to genome-wide association study loci. We observed a notable abundance of rare high-impact SVs associated with aberrant expression of nearby genes. These results suggest that comprehensive WGS-based SV analyses will increase the power of common- and rare-variant association studies.},

However, in applications of the next-generation sequencing (NGS), accurate genotypes may not be easily obtained (e.g. multi-sample low-coverage sequencing or somatic mutation discovery). These applications press for the development of new methods for analyzing sequence data with uncertainty., Results: We present a statistical framework for calling SNPs, discovering somatic mutations, inferring population genetical parameters and performing association tests directly based on sequencing data without explicit genotyping or linkage-based imputation. On real data, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to alternative methods for estimating site allele count, for inferring allele frequency spectrum and for association mapping. We also highlight the necessity of using symmetric datasets for finding somatic mutations and confirm that for discovering rare events, mismapping is frequently the leading source of errors., Availability: http://samtools.sourceforge.net, Contact: hengli@broadinstitute.org},

Insertions and deletions (indels) are a common source of variation and can frequently impact functionality, thus making their detection vitally important. While substantial effort has gone into detecting indels from DNA, there is still opportunity for improvement. Further, detection of indels from RNA-Seq data has largely been an afterthought and offers another critical area for variant detection.We present here ABRA2, a redesign of the original ABRA implementation that offers support for realignment of both RNA and DNA short reads. The process results in improved accuracy and scalability including support for human whole genomes. Results demonstrate substantial improvement in indel detection for a variety of data types, including those that were not previously supported by ABRA. Further, ABRA2 results in broad improvements to variant calling accuracy across a wide range of post-processing workflows including whole genomes, targeted exomes and transcriptome sequencing.ABRA2 is implemented in a combination of Java and C/C++ and is freely available to all from: https://github.com/mozack/abra2.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
